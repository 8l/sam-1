/* This file defines the keyboard mappings for keyboard commands.
 * The lines are of the form:
 *
 *    {mask, keysym, kind, action}
 *
 * mask   - one of the X modifier masks, or the user-configured COMMANDMASK
 * keysym - one of the X symbolic keysym names
 * kind   - Kcommand for commands
 *          Kraw for literal characters
 *          Kcomposed for composed characters
 * action - for Kraw and Kcomposed, a single character
 *          for Kcommand, one of the commands below
 *
 * Available commands are:
 *
 * Clineup      - move up by line
 * Clinedown    - move down by line
 * Ccharright   - move right by character
 * Ccharleft    - move left by character
 * Cdelbol      - delete to beginning of line
 * Cdelword     - delete previous word
 * Cdel         - delete previous character
 * Cjump        - jump to and from the command window
 * Cescape      - highlight recently typed text
 *
 * The default configuration shipped with sam has the keyboard commands mapped
 * to the "classic" Unix sam of the 1980s, plus the WordStar Diamond for cursor
 * movement.
 *
 * Another popular choice is to map to vi-like bindings, see below.

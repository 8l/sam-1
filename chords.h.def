/* This file defines mappings of mouse chords to commands.
 * The lines are of the form:
 *
 *    {start, end, kind, action}
 *
 * start    - the start state (i.e. what mouse buttons were pressed)
 * end      - the end state (i.e. what mouse buttons are now pressed)
 * action   - one of the commands listed in commands.h (or commands.h.def)
 *
 * The following values are available for state definitions:
 *      None    - No buttons are pressed
 *      B[1-5]  - Button n is pressed
 *
 * The Bn masks can be combined using the "|" operator, so
 * "B1|B2" means "both buttons 1 and 2 pressed".
 *
 * The default configuration shipped with sam has the mouse chords of the
 * "classic" Unix sam of the 1980s.
